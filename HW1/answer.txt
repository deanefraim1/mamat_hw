A. We assume that without bash it will take a really long time to do that mission manually
B. Our conclusions from this practice are:
	*there are programs that are eaisier to run and write in bash than c.
	*there are missions that their execution will take a lot of time compared to bash.
   For example, we can use bash to check website coverage on a certein person, and use this information to understand the public opinion on the person.
   In addition we can use this idea to check on someone's obscene habits.
C. First we will use crontab to execute the script every one houre.
   To avoid repetition of certain links we will add an IF condition befor the printing in lines 12 that will check if the link we are trying to add is already exists in the results.csv file using "grep -Fxq"
